This workshop provides a comprehensive guide on how to automate the process of building Docker images from a GitHub repository and pushing them to Amazon ECR using AWS CodeBuild. Participants will gain hands-on experience in setting up and configuring AWS services to streamline the CI/CD pipeline for containerized applications.

### Key Topics Covered:

+ Introduction to AWS CodeBuild, Docker, and Amazon ECR: Learn the basics of AWS CodeBuild, Docker, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and understand how they work together in a CI/CD pipeline.

+ Prerequisites: Ensure you have an AWS account with access to IAM, CodeBuild, and ECR, a GitHub repository with a Dockerfile, AWS CLI configured, and Docker installed locally.

+ IAM Role Configuration: Set up the necessary IAM roles and permissions to allow CodeBuild to interact with other AWS services securely.

+ Setting Up AWS CodeBuild: Configure a CodeBuild project that will automatically build Docker images from the code in your GitHub repository.

+ Pushing Docker Images to Amazon ECR: Use AWS CodeBuild to push the Docker images to Amazon ECR after they are built.

+ Understanding the buildspec.yml File: Break down the buildspec.yml file, which defines the steps CodeBuild will take to build and push your Docker images.

+ Step-by-Step Implementation: Follow a detailed, step-by-step guide to set up the entire pipeline, from configuring AWS services to writing the buildspec.yml file and deploying the Docker images.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a fully automated pipeline that builds Docker images from your source code and pushes them to Amazon ECR, ready for deployment in a production environment.
